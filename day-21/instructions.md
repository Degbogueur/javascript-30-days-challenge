## Day 21 â€“ Higher-Order Functions

### Exercises
1. Use `map` to square each number in `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
2. Use `filter` to get all even numbers from `[10, 15, 20, 25, 30]`.
3. Use `reduce` to sum numbers in `[5, 10, 15]`.
4. Chain `map` and `filter`: double numbers greater than `5` from `[2, 4, 6, 8]`.
