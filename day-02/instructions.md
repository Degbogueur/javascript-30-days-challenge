## Day 2 â€“ Operators & Expressions

### Exercises
1. Write an expression that adds, subtracts, multiplies, and divides two numbers.  
2. Compare two numbers and print whether the first is greater, smaller, or equal.  
3. Write a program that determines if a person is allowed to enter a club.

    The conditions are:
    - The person must be **at least 18 years old**.  
    - They must either:  
        - Have a **membership card** (`hasCard = true`) **OR**  
        - Pay an **entry fee** (`paidFee = true`).  
    - People who are **banned** (`isBanned = true`) are **never allowed**, regardless of other conditions.
    
    **Task:**  
    Use logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`) to check these conditions and print whether the person can enter the club.

4. You are planning to buy some items.

    Create an expression that checks whether the **total cost** of the two items is within your budget.
    
    If so, print "You can afford both items."  
    Otherwise, print "Not enough budget."
