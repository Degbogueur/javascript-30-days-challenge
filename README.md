# 30 Days of JavaScript Challenge

Welcome to my **30-Day JavaScript Challenge!!**  
This repo documents my journey through JavaScript concepts by solving daily exercises and building mini projects.  

Each day focuses on a specific concept (variables, loops, arrays, functions, objects, async, etc.), with small exercises and bigger challenges.  
By the end of the 30 days, Iâ€™ll have solved dozens of problems and built small apps that combine multiple JS features.
